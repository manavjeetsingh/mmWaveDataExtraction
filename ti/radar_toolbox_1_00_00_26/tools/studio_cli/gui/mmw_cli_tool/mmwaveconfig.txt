#IWR1443, IWR1642, IWR1843, IWR6843
#For AWR1243 and AWR2243 device This tool uses SPI interface and uses JSON 
# file for configuration input
#For other devices it uses UART COM port and can use CFG or JSON input file.
#
#@Note: For AWR1243/AWR2243 
#		a. If FW_DOWNLOAD_ENABLE=1 & FLASH_CONNECTED_TO_SENSOR=1
#			then: Flash matching MetaImage binary file to device first.
#       b. Set LVDS Lanes (DCA_LVDS_LANE_MODE=4)
