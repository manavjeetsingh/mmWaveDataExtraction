mmWave PostProc is tool to process the captured RAW ADC data from mmwave Sensors using DCA1000EVM.

Features:
1. Using this tool user can plot the data without opening the mmWave-Studio GUI.
2. It can take JSON file as an input which is generated by either mmWave-Studio or SensingEstimator
3. For mmWave SDK based application, same tool can take *.cfg file as input configuration.

Pre-requisite: Matlab Runtime Engine 2015a 32-bit (follow user guide)

How to run:

DeviceType: AWR1243, AWR1843, AWR1642, AWR2243

:\> mmwave_postproc.exe <workspace path> <full path for JSON/cfg file> <full path for ADC bin file> <DeviceType>

e.g. (make sure that directory and file exist)
:\> mmwave_postproc.exe c:\ti\postproc  c:\ti\postproc\config.mmwave.json  c:\ti\postproc\adc_data_raw_0.bin  AWR1843
